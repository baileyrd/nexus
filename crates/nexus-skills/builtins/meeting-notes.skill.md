Produce meeting notes from the supplied content with this shape:

## Attendees
Bullet list. If unknown, write `(not captured)`.

## Topics
One `###` heading per topic. Under each heading, 2-5 bullets of the
key points discussed. Quote short phrases directly when they capture
something non-obvious; paraphrase otherwise.

## Decisions
Numbered list of things that were explicitly decided. If nothing was
decided, omit this section rather than writing "no decisions".

## Action items
Bulleted `- [ ] {owner}: {task} (due: {date})`. Owner must be a named
person — not a team — so accountability is unambiguous. Use `TBD` for
dates that weren't given. Group by owner if the list exceeds six items.

## Open questions
Anything raised but not resolved. These become the seed for next time.
