# Documentation Archive

> Historical documentation: completed implementation plans, point-in-time
> audits, pre-migration designs, and reference material for code that no
> longer exists. Reorganized 2026-04-26.

Nothing here is deleted. Anything moved into this folder has an
`> **Archived <date>** — <reason>` line at the top of the file
explaining why it's no longer in the active set.

## When to look here

- You need the *historical* context for a decision (the design that
  led to the current code, or the migration that produced it).
- A commit message, ADR, or older doc references a plan or audit by
  filename and you need to read it.
- You're tracing why a feature works the way it does and the current
  architecture doc points back to a superseded plan.

For anything load-bearing for current development, **read the docs in
the parent directory first** (`docs/architecture/C4.md`,
`docs/architecture/leaf-architecture.md`,
`docs/architecture/legacy-shell-retirement.md`,
`docs/PRDs/`, `docs/adr/`).

`shell/docs/archive/` mirrors this pattern for docs scoped to the
shell crate. See [`shell/docs/archive/`](../../shell/docs/archive/)
