## New Features (not addressed in any PRD)

## Partially New Features (concept exists in PRDs but design is unspecified)

### BL-007: CRDT-over-Git Transport

**Source**: PRD 11, Section 4.4 (Level 3)
**Effort**: Large (2–3 weeks)
**Crate**: `nexus-git`, new `nexus-crdt`
**Related PRD**: PRD 11 (specified but deferred — requires collaborative editing layer)

Serialize Nexus CRDT state (rich text buffer) as JSON in `.nexus/crdt-state.json`, tracked in git. On push, CRDT state is included in commits. On pull with merge conflict in the CRDT file, apply CRDT merge semantics (operation-based or state-based) for automatic convergence. Fallback to content conflict if CRDT merge fails. Enables multi-user async collaboration via git push/pull without manual conflict resolution. Prerequisite: a CRDT-based editor engine (PRD 08) or collaborative editing layer.

---

## Post-migration carryover gaps (2026-04-24)

Capabilities described in legacy `app/` documentation that were not carried over to `shell/` during the Phase 4 WI-37 retirement. Full descriptions and acceptance criteria in [../OPEN-ITEMS.md](../OPEN-ITEMS.md). Resolved entries are archived in [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md).

### Open

- [ ] **OI-05: Rust dep duplication** — Blocked on upstream. 34 crates with duplicated versions all trace through `wasmtime 42` (toml/sha2/digest/rand_core/reqwest/rustix/nix/hashbrown) or `portable-pty → filedescriptor` (`thiserror 1`). Revisit after the next wasmtime major release.
- [ ] **OI-15: Manifest signature / provenance** — Optional `manifest.toml.sig` Ed25519 over manifest bytes, verified against trusted-publisher keyring. Marketplace prerequisite (paired with WI-44).
- [ ] **OI-16: `beforeunload` → `onStop` for script plugins** — Window-close hook with 1s per-plugin soft cap so flush-on-stop handlers run on ⌘Q.
- [ ] **OI-17: Deprecation policy + `@deprecated` JSDoc** — `packages/nexus-extension-api/DEPRECATED.md` + JSDoc tags + ESLint rule failing imports of deprecated names.
- [ ] **OI-18: Snippet trigger collision detection** — Same hazard as OI-10 but for snippets; emit `plugins:snippet-conflict` and surface a "which plugin wins" control.
- [ ] **OI-20: Terminal copy/paste** — xterm has built-in selection but no copy/paste is wired up in `TerminalView.tsx`. Need Ctrl+Shift+C / Ctrl+Shift+V (and Cmd+C / Cmd+V on macOS — note plain Ctrl+C must stay SIGINT to the PTY), right-click context menu, and routing through `navigator.clipboard` with the Tauri clipboard plugin as fallback. Bracketed-paste mode should be honored so the shell can opt into safe paste handling.

### Resolved (preserved here for cross-reference; full notes in [../OPEN-ITEMS.md](../OPEN-ITEMS.md))

- [x] OI-01 — Settings modal + `registerSettingsTab` API _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-02 — Split-size persistence (editor splits gained drag handles + `setSplitSizes` mutator) _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-03 — Workspace-wide clippy `-D warnings` sweep _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-04 — Kernel-contract promotion TODOs (`SlotId` and `list_archetypes` IPC) _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-06 — ESLint 8 → 9 + typescript-eslint 7 → 8 + xterm → `@xterm/*` scoped _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-07 — Capability grants/denials/path-traversal routed through `audit::*` _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-08 — "Running Extensions" Settings tab (live plugin state + errors + Disable) _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-09 — `pluginsStatusStore` aggregates plugin lifecycle events into a per-plugin `{ state, lastError }` map _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-10 — `KeybindingRegistry.getConflicts()` + `plugins:keybindings-conflict` event with signature-dedup; per-row `!` badge + summary banner in Settings → Keybindings _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-11 — `CommandRegistry.execute` races handlers against a configurable cancel deadline (`shell.command.timeoutCancelMs`, default 5s) with a soft warn at `shell.command.timeoutWarnMs` (default 250ms); emits `command:cancelled` and throws `CommandCancelledError` so the palette can dismiss in-flight state _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-12 — Auto-promotion was already gone on the kernel side; this pass tightened the `confine_path` / `read_file` doc comments to spell out the contract, documented the script-plugin `PlatformFsAPI` path-semantics in `@nexus/extension-api`, and added two kernel tests that pin the loud `PermissionDenied` + traversal-message AC for absolute reads / writes _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-13 — Deleted dead `nexus_kernel::PluginRegistry` + `Kernel::plugins()` (zero callers; `PluginLoader::loaded` is authoritative) _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-14 — `api.workspace.forgeRoot()` + `api.editor.active()/onChange()` exposed via `@nexus/extension-api` _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-19 — Deferred createRoot/unmount in `TerminalPaneView` + `EmptyView`; React 18 commit-phase warnings on drawer collapse + StrictMode double-mount cleared _(2026-04-27)_

## Formal release scope (deferred)

Tracked in full in [../REQUIRED-FOR-FORMAL-RELEASE.md](../REQUIRED-FOR-FORMAL-RELEASE.md). Out of scope for personal-tool use; surface here so the IDs are findable.

- [ ] **WI-41: Tauri auto-updater + code-signing + release channel.** ~5–7 eng-days plus 1–3 weeks calendar for signing-cert procurement.
- [ ] **WI-42: Crash reporting & telemetry.** ~5 eng-days, opt-in via Settings.
- [ ] **WI-44: Minimal marketplace.** ~5 eng-days; index schema + shell UI + CLI install + tarball publishing. Paired with **OI-15** (manifest signing) and **F-8.1.1 / F-8.1.2** (iframe sandbox + boundary-bound `pluginId`) before opening to untrusted plugins.
- [ ] **WI-46: Beta → GA logistics.** Triage rubric, test-group recruitment, ship criteria. ~3 eng-days plus 2-week calendar.

---

## Future directions (exploratory, not phased)

Design-only docs without committed timelines. Treat as inspiration / option pool, not as work in flight. If any of these get scoped into a phase, mint an ID here and link the doc as the design rationale.

- [ ] **AI integration directions** — 8 ordered directions (inline rewrite/summarize, auto-link suggestions, semantic search, per-surface chat, skills as prompts, agent loops, MCP exposure, background indexing). See [../AI-INTEGRATION-DIRECTIONS.md](../AI-INTEGRATION-DIRECTIONS.md).
- [ ] **Ambient copilot UX patterns** — 10 patterns (Cmd+I overlay, context chips, model switcher, ghost suggestions, right-click AI actions, margin suggestions, activity timeline, citations, inline correction, capture → AI). See [../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md](../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md).
- [ ] **AI memory layer (Pieces.app-style)** — 6-piece build plan (quick-capture hotkey, auto-enrichment on save, recall hotkey, implicit chat context, code-aware capture, scheduled digests). See [../AI-MEMORY-LAYER-PLAN.md](../AI-MEMORY-LAYER-PLAN.md).
- [ ] **Notion-style block UX — out-of-scope follow-ups.** Phases 1–6 of the plan landed 2026-04-22 (see "Spec'd in a PRD, not yet implemented" below for the entry). The plan itself enumerates explicit out-of-scope items: drag-to-embed into canvas, block-links navigator (`[[…#^block-id]]`), side-margin comments subsystem, block AI actions via `com.nexus.ai`, multi-cursor from multi-block selection. See `docs/notion-block-ux-plan.md`.

---

## Settings extraction queue

Inventory of named-constant / hardcoded settings candidates lives in [../../shell/HARDCODED_SETTINGS_AUDIT.md](../../shell/HARDCODED_SETTINGS_AUDIT.md). Pickable in any order; each is a 1–2 hour change.

- [ ] **Zoom settings schema** — `ui.zoomStep`, `ui.zoomMin`, `ui.zoomMax`, `ui.zoomDefault`. Constants already named in `shell/src/plugins/core/zoom/index.ts:15–18`.
- [ ] **Notification durations schema** — 5 hardcoded ms values in `notificationService` + ChatView + SavedCommandsView.
- [ ] **Search / palette result limits** — `search.maxResultsLimit`, `commandPalette.maxResultsLimit`.
- [ ] **Long-running operation timeout consolidation** — 3 independent `5 * 60_000` literals in AI / agent / workflow crates; consolidate into `LONG_RUNNING_OP_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- [ ] **Buffer / event caps** — Name `PROCESS_EVENTS_CAP`, `BASES_HISTORY_CAP`, `CANVAS_HISTORY_CAP`, etc.; consider a shared `UNDO_HISTORY_CAP`.

## Architecture review (2026-04-16) — microkernel adherence

## UI architecture review (2026-04-16) — editor-shell pattern

### Code gaps

### PRD gap — no owner for plugin-contributed tab surfaces

## Editor-shell capability gaps (2026-04-16) — vs VS Code / Obsidian / IntelliJ

### Spec'd in a PRD, not yet implemented

- [ ] **`.bases` database renderer in the shell (PRD-10).** Phases
  1–6 landed 2026-04-22 along with every deferred tail item.
  Kernel surface: `com.nexus.storage::base_*` ids 40–52
  (including 49 `base_create`, 50 `base_property_rename`, 51
  `base_record_soft_delete`, 52 `base_record_restore`);
  `com.nexus.database::csv_import` / `csv_export` / `formula_eval`.
  Wire schema grew two slots in the same pass: `ViewType` now
  includes `List` + `Timeline`, `BaseView` gained `end_field`
  (timeline end-date pairing with the existing `date_field` as
  start), and `BaseRecord` gained `deleted_at: Option<i64>` to
  carry the soft-delete state. Shell code under
  `shell/src/plugins/nexus/bases/`. Phase-6 work: CSV + undo +
  formula live preview, `@tanstack/react-virtual` windowing,
  "New base" Files-toolbar action → `NewBaseDialog` template
  picker, `SchemaEditor` side panel with rename / retype
  (migrate_values) / formula editor, list + timeline view
  persistence via `viewMapping.ts`, and soft-delete: `BasesView`
  filters `deletedAt != null` out of every live view's visible
  set but keeps them on the base for the SchemaEditor and a
  future trash view. Only truly open follow-ups now: a trash-view
  UI surfacing soft-deleted records and a table-virtualization
  retest when very large (>50k) bases land.
- [ ] **`.canvas` board renderer in the shell (PRD-06 §4).** Phases
  1–6 complete 2026-04-22 — every deferred Phase-6 item closed in
  the same session. Kernel surface:
  `com.nexus.storage::canvas_read` / `canvas_write` /
  `canvas_patch` / `canvas_nodes` / `canvas_edges` (handler ids
  35–39), with `SetBackground` added to `CanvasPatchOp`. Shell
  code under `shell/src/plugins/nexus/canvas/` covers the full
  editing loop (selection / marquee / resize / drag / delete /
  undo-redo / edge drag / inspector) plus the Phase-5 DOM overlay
  (`CanvasOverlay` — markdown, file embeds, OG cards, `.bases`
  mini-grid, terminal sessions) and the Phase-6 polish tier
  (minimap, Tidy auto-layout, grid toggle, zoom-to-fit / zoom-to-
  selection, help overlay). Phase-6 closers (2026-04-22):
  `exportFormats.ts` uses `html-to-image` + `jspdf` to produce
  overlay-inclusive PNG / SVG / PDF (the Export control-strip
  button opens a 3-option popover); a new optional
  `CanvasBackground { color, pattern? }` field on `CanvasFile`
  drives per-canvas background color + dots/grid/lines pattern,
  edited from the Inspector's `CANVAS` section behind a `BG`
  control-strip button; canvas shortcuts now route through the
  shell `KeybindingRegistry` via manifest contributions with a
  `canvas.focused` context-key gate, and every shortcut is also
  a palette-accessible `canvas.*` command.
- [ ] **Notion-style block UX on top of the existing block-tree engine
  (PRD-08).** Phases 1–6 of the plan landed 2026-04-22. Shell-only:
  every mutation drives the doc through plain CM
  `dispatch({ changes })` + the existing `editor_sync_content`
  reparse — no new kernel IPC. Five CodeMirror extensions under
  `shell/src/plugins/nexus/editor/cm/`: **`slashCommand.ts`** (typing
  `/` at block start opens a categorised palette with
  filter-as-you-type + runtime registry for plugin-contributed
  commands); **`blockSelection.ts`** (Cmd/Ctrl+A expands caret →
  block → document; Shift+Arrow at block edges steps by whole
  blocks); **`blockHandle.ts`** (6-dot grip overlay per block,
  click-menu with Turn-into submenu + Duplicate / Move up / Move
  down / Delete, drag-to-reorder with a live drop-line indicator,
  `Alt-ArrowUp/Down` keyboard equivalents); **`inputRules.ts`**
  (`[]`/`[x]`/`*`/`+` space-normalization rules that fill the gap
  where user expectation diverges from raw markdown);
  **`inlineToolbar.ts`** (floating Bold/Italic/Code/Link toolbar
  above non-empty single-block selections plus
  `Mod-b/i/e/k` shortcuts with wrap/unwrap toggle).
  Explicitly out of scope for this pass and tracked as separate
  follow-ups: drag-to-embed into canvas (cross-plugin), block
  links navigator (`[[…#^block-id]]`), side-margin comments
  subsystem, block AI actions via `com.nexus.ai`, multi-cursor
  from multi-block selection.
  Kernel asks addressed 2026-04-22: (1) `Transaction::move_block(tree,
  id, new_parent, new_index, metadata)` constructor landed — single
  `ReparentBlock` op = single undo step for block-drag. Fixed an
  incidental `ReparentBlock::reverse` bug where same-parent backward
  moves couldn't be cleanly reversed (the existing
  `reparent_roundtrip` test was cross-parent and missed it). (2)
  Block-id stability over save+reopen: `deterministic_block_id` keys
  on `(file_path, visit_order, block_type)`, so ids are stable for
  files that round-trip unchanged. An insert mid-document shifts
  `visit_order` for every downstream block and produces new ids on
  reload — the plan's proposed fixes (HTML-comment stamping in
  markdown or an out-of-band `.forge/blocks.json` sidecar) remain
  the options. Left deferred until the Phase-6 block-link UX forces
  a choice, since today no feature depends on cross-session block
  id stability under edits.

### Half-specced: manifest keys exist, but no UI/wiring spec in PRD-07

### Not in any PRD — new spec work needed

## Architecture audit (2026-04-16) — follow-ups

Findings surfaced by the microkernel + editor-shell audit that weren't already tracked above.

## Microkernel hardening — 2026-04-16 audit findings

Findings from `docs/archive/planning/MICROKERNEL-AUDIT.md` not yet tracked. Ordered by audit priority. The three 🔴 items and F-9.2.1 are blockers before any public plugin marketplace.

### 🔴 Red — blockers for untrusted plugin distribution

_None outstanding._ F-2.1.1 closed 2026-04-22 — see archive.

### 🟠 Orange — address before marketplace or next minor release

### 🟡 Yellow — quality / correctness improvements

## Suspected issues — not fully investigated

Threads from `docs/archive/planning/MICROKERNEL-AUDIT.md §Suspected Issues` that warrant a targeted code walk.

- [ ] **Hot-reload timing on macOS and Windows.** `notify-debouncer-mini` behaviour differs across platforms; F-4.3.1 covers one class of issue. A targeted cross-platform reliability pass on the hot-reload path would be worthwhile before shipping community plugin hot-reload as a feature. **Deferred** — requires running the shell on macOS and Windows hardware to reproduce and measure; this repo's test host is Linux/WSL only. Track for a dedicated cross-platform QA pass once a macOS/Windows CI runner or test machine is available.

## UI audit (2026-04-16) — follow-ups

Findings from `docs/archive/planning/UI-AUDIT.md` not yet tracked above. IDs reference the audit. The 🔴 items plus F-9.1.1 are blockers before any untrusted-plugin distribution.

### 🔴 Red — cannot ship to untrusted users without these

- [ ] **Move JS script plugin execution into a sandboxed iframe (UI F-8.1.1).** The script-runtime loader (`shell/src/host/ExtensionHost.ts` + `shell/src/host/communityPluginLoader.ts` + `shell/src/host/sandbox/`, superseding the legacy shell's `scriptRuntime.ts:61-67`) loads plugin modules via `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([...], { type: "application/javascript" }))` + `import(url)` straight into the main WebView thread. Combined with F-5.1.2 (no CSP) and F-2.2.1 (JS caps unenforced), an untrusted plugin has full DOM + `invoke` + `localStorage` + `fetch` access. Fix: host JS plugins in an `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">` (no `allow-same-origin`) with a typed `postMessage` protocol; expose `NexusPluginContext` as a message-passing proxy. Large effort (1–2 eng-months) but required by the stated trust model.
- [ ] **Bind `pluginId` at the sandbox boundary, not in the JS context (UI F-8.1.2).** The host plugin API (`shell/src/host/PluginAPI.ts` + `shell/src/host/shellRegistry.ts`, superseding the legacy shell's `nexusContext.ts:184`) — `createNexusContext(pluginId)` trusts the string; any plugin can re-create a context claiming another plugin's id, affecting `ctx.events.emit`, `ctx.ui.notify` `source`, settings namespace, and per-plugin disposables. Fix: derive identity at the iframe/worker boundary (depends on F-8.1.1); reject any host call whose asserted id disagrees with the boundary id.

> F-9.1.1 (validate `api_version` at load time) is the UI twin of the microkernel 🟠 item of the same ID already tracked above — no duplicate entry.

### 🟠 Orange — substantive design gaps, schedule before next external release

- [ ] **Memory budget / accounting for script plugins (UI F-8.3.1).** WASM plugins have `memory_mb = 8` in their manifest; script plugins have no equivalent and allocate against the WebView heap directly. A plugin that accumulates a 500 MB structure OOMs the whole shell. **Deferred — blocked on UI F-8.1.1 iframe sandbox.** `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()` is per-frame, so meaningful accounting requires the per-plugin iframe boundary to land first. Today a misbehaving script plugin's RSS is indistinguishable from the shell's. Re-open this item when F-8.1.1 ships.

### 🟡 Yellow — rough edges to fix opportunistically

### Suspected issues — UI audit §6 spike candidates

Threads from `docs/archive/planning/UI-AUDIT.md §6` not yet confirmed. Each is a 1–2 day targeted code walk or runtime probe.

- [ ] **SI-1 — Blob-URL same-origin inheritance.** **Deferred — verified as expected, conclusion pending UI F-8.1.1.** The MDN spec on blob URLs is clear: a `blob:` URL inherits the origin of the page that created it, so a plugin module loaded via `URL.createObjectURL` + `import()` runs in the shell's origin and can read `window.top`, `document.cookie`, and invoke any Tauri command the allowlist exposes. This is precisely the hole the UI F-8.1.1 iframe sandbox closes. No separate mitigation is tractable without that boundary; track as duplicate of F-8.1.1 for closure.
- [ ] **SI-6 — `PluginManager` Mutex contention.** **Deferred — requires a dedicated load-test harness that doesn't exist yet.** Measuring requires 20+ chatty plugins and wall-clock profiling while a human drives the UI, which this environment cannot replicate. Hypothesis: per-plugin dispatch already uses `try_lock` + reentrancy guard + per-plugin backend mutex, so the `PluginManager` top-level mutex is only held during scan/load/unload/reload — not during steady-state dispatch. If the hypothesis holds this is cosmetic; if not, the fix is likely `RwLock<HashMap<id, …>>` inside the loader with per-plugin reader locks. Track as an explicit Phase-3 stability task once the load-test tooling exists.

## Decisions — PRD-04 audit (2026-04-17)
