## New Features (not addressed in any PRD)

_BL-009 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

## Partially New Features (concept exists in PRDs but design is unspecified)

### BL-007: CRDT-over-Git Transport

**Source**: PRD 11, Section 4.4 (Level 3)
**Effort**: Large (2–3 weeks)
**Crate**: `nexus-git`, new `nexus-crdt`
**Related PRD**: PRD 11 (specified but deferred — requires collaborative editing layer)

Serialize Nexus CRDT state (rich text buffer) as JSON in `.nexus/crdt-state.json`, tracked in git. On push, CRDT state is included in commits. On pull with merge conflict in the CRDT file, apply CRDT merge semantics (operation-based or state-based) for automatic convergence. Fallback to content conflict if CRDT merge fails. Enables multi-user async collaboration via git push/pull without manual conflict resolution. Prerequisite: a CRDT-based editor engine (PRD 08) or collaborative editing layer.

---

## Post-migration carryover gaps (2026-04-24)

Capabilities described in legacy `app/` documentation that were not carried over to `shell/` during the Phase 4 WI-37 retirement. Full descriptions and acceptance criteria in [../OPEN-ITEMS.md](../OPEN-ITEMS.md). Resolved entries are archived in [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md).

### Open

- [ ] **OI-05: Rust dep duplication** — Blocked on upstream. 34 crates with duplicated versions all trace through `wasmtime 42` (toml/sha2/digest/rand_core/reqwest/rustix/nix/hashbrown) or `portable-pty → filedescriptor` (`thiserror 1`). Revisit after the next wasmtime major release.
- [ ] **OI-15: Manifest signature / provenance** — Optional `manifest.toml.sig` Ed25519 over manifest bytes, verified against trusted-publisher keyring. Marketplace prerequisite (paired with WI-44).
- [ ] **OI-18: Snippet trigger collision detection** — Same hazard as OI-10 but for snippets; emit `plugins:snippet-conflict` and surface a "which plugin wins" control. **Blocked: no snippet registry exists yet.** `Snippet` type + `editor.registerSnippet` are declared in [`@nexus/extension-api`](../../packages/nexus-extension-api/src/index.ts#L101) but never implemented in the shell — every existing "snippet" reference is the unrelated CSS theme-snippet system. Doing this properly means building the script-plugin code-snippet registry first; closer to OI-15 than OI-10 in scope. Reopen when `registerSnippet` lands.

### Resolved (preserved here for cross-reference; full notes in [../OPEN-ITEMS.md](../OPEN-ITEMS.md))

- [x] OI-01 — Settings modal + `registerSettingsTab` API _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-02 — Split-size persistence (editor splits gained drag handles + `setSplitSizes` mutator) _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-03 — Workspace-wide clippy `-D warnings` sweep _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-04 — Kernel-contract promotion TODOs (`SlotId` and `list_archetypes` IPC) _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-06 — ESLint 8 → 9 + typescript-eslint 7 → 8 + xterm → `@xterm/*` scoped _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-07 — Capability grants/denials/path-traversal routed through `audit::*` _(2026-04-24)_
- [x] OI-08 — "Running Extensions" Settings tab (live plugin state + errors + Disable) _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-09 — `pluginsStatusStore` aggregates plugin lifecycle events into a per-plugin `{ state, lastError }` map _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-10 — `KeybindingRegistry.getConflicts()` + `plugins:keybindings-conflict` event with signature-dedup; per-row `!` badge + summary banner in Settings → Keybindings _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-11 — `CommandRegistry.execute` races handlers against a configurable cancel deadline (`shell.command.timeoutCancelMs`, default 5s) with a soft warn at `shell.command.timeoutWarnMs` (default 250ms); emits `command:cancelled` and throws `CommandCancelledError` so the palette can dismiss in-flight state _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-12 — Auto-promotion was already gone on the kernel side; this pass tightened the `confine_path` / `read_file` doc comments to spell out the contract, documented the script-plugin `PlatformFsAPI` path-semantics in `@nexus/extension-api`, and added two kernel tests that pin the loud `PermissionDenied` + traversal-message AC for absolute reads / writes _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-13 — Deleted dead `nexus_kernel::PluginRegistry` + `Kernel::plugins()` (zero callers; `PluginLoader::loaded` is authoritative) _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-16 — `ExtensionHost.deactivateAllForShutdown(perPluginCapMs)` runs every active plugin's `deactivate()` in parallel with a per-plugin soft cap; wired from a `beforeunload` listener in `main.tsx` so flush-on-stop hooks get one last shot before the WebView tears down _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-17 — Deprecation policy lands as a three-way handshake — `@deprecated` JSDoc on the symbol + an entry in `packages/nexus-extension-api/DEPRECATED.md` + an `importNames` row in `shell/eslint.config.js`'s `no-restricted-imports` block. CI gate works without enabling type-aware lint (kept defer-decision intact); empty list today, table headers + protocol ready for the first deprecation _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-20 — Terminal copy/paste — `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` claims `Ctrl+Shift+C/V` (Linux/Windows) and `Cmd+C/V` (macOS) without disturbing plain `Ctrl+C` SIGINT, right-click pastes from clipboard, paste honours bracketed-paste mode (`\e[200~ … \e[201~`) when xterm signals it. Uses `navigator.clipboard.{read,write}Text` from user-gesture handlers; denial logs a follow-up note pointing at `@tauri-apps/plugin-clipboard-manager` _(2026-04-27)_
- [x] OI-14 — `api.workspace.forgeRoot()` + `api.editor.active()/onChange()` exposed via `@nexus/extension-api` _(2026-04-26)_
- [x] OI-19 — Deferred createRoot/unmount in `TerminalPaneView` + `EmptyView`; React 18 commit-phase warnings on drawer collapse + StrictMode double-mount cleared _(2026-04-27)_

---

## Formal release scope (deferred)

Tracked in full in [../REQUIRED-FOR-FORMAL-RELEASE.md](../REQUIRED-FOR-FORMAL-RELEASE.md). Out of scope for personal-tool use; surface here so the IDs are findable.

- [ ] **WI-41: Tauri auto-updater + code-signing + release channel.** ~5–7 eng-days plus 1–3 weeks calendar for signing-cert procurement.
- [ ] **WI-42: Crash reporting & telemetry.** ~5 eng-days, opt-in via Settings.
- [ ] **WI-44: Minimal marketplace.** ~5 eng-days; index schema + shell UI + CLI install + tarball publishing. Paired with **OI-15** (manifest signing) and **F-8.1.1 / F-8.1.2** (iframe sandbox + boundary-bound `pluginId`) before opening to untrusted plugins.
- [ ] **WI-46: Beta → GA logistics.** Triage rubric, test-group recruitment, ship criteria. ~3 eng-days plus 2-week calendar.

---

## Future directions (scoped 2026-04-28)

Previously: design-only docs without committed timelines. **Scoped into the implementation plan on 2026-04-28** — each FD piece now has a BL-* ID (see "Future-direction items minted into the backlog" above) and the docs themselves remain authoritative for design rationale.

- **AI integration directions** — see [../AI-INTEGRATION-DIRECTIONS.md](../AI-INTEGRATION-DIRECTIONS.md). Mapping: "inline rewrite/summarize" → BL-034 (engine) + BL-035 (action surface); "auto-link suggestions" → BL-039; "semantic search" → BL-040; "per-surface chat" → merged into BL-010 (reshape note); "skills as prompts" → composed via BL-021 / BL-022; "agent loops" → merged into BL-027 (same surface); "MCP exposure" (Nexus-as-server) → BL-042; "background indexing" → BL-041. Direction "tool-calling" was already BL-016.
- **Ambient copilot UX patterns** — see [../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md](../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md). Mapping: Cmd+I overlay → BL-032; context chips + model switcher → BL-033; ghost suggestions → BL-034; right-click AI actions → BL-035 (shared with NB block AI actions); margin suggestions + inline correction → BL-036; activity timeline → BL-037; citations → BL-038; capture → AI → folded into BL-043 (memory quick-capture).
- **AI memory layer** — see [../AI-MEMORY-LAYER-PLAN.md](../AI-MEMORY-LAYER-PLAN.md). Mapping: quick-capture → BL-043; auto-enrichment on save → BL-045; recall hotkey → BL-044; implicit chat context → merged into BL-010 (reshape note); code-aware capture → BL-046; scheduled digests → BL-047.
- **Notion-style block UX out-of-scope follow-ups** — see [../notion-block-ux-plan.md](../notion-block-ux-plan.md). Mapping: drag-to-embed into canvas → BL-048; block-links navigator → BL-049 (gated on block-id stability ADR); side-margin comments → BL-050; block AI actions → merged into BL-035; multi-cursor from multi-block → BL-051.

## Settings extraction queue

Inventory of named-constant / hardcoded settings candidates lives in [../../shell/HARDCODED_SETTINGS_AUDIT.md](../../shell/HARDCODED_SETTINGS_AUDIT.md). Pickable in any order; each is a 1–2 hour change.

- [x] **Zoom settings schema** _(shipped)_ — `ui.zoomStep` / `ui.zoomMin` / `ui.zoomMax` / `ui.zoomDefault` registered in `shell/src/plugins/core/zoom/index.ts` with bounds, step, and reset target read through `api.configuration.getValue` + `onChange`.
- [x] **Notification durations schema** _(shipped)_ — `ui.notificationDurationMs` (notificationService), `ui.fileCreationNotificationMs` (fileExplorer), `ui.commandSaveNotificationMs` + `ui.commandCopiedNotificationMs` (terminal `index.ts` schema; SavedCommandsView reads via `useConfigValue`), `ui.copiedNotificationMs` (`nexus.ai`'s `index.ts`; ChatView reads via `useConfigValue`).
- [x] **Search / palette result limits** _(shipped)_ — `search.maxResultsLimit` (schema in `shell/src/plugins/nexus/search/index.ts`, read in `searchRuntime.ts`); `commandPalette.maxResultsLimit` (schema in `shell/src/plugins/core/commandPalette/index.ts`, read by `match.ts`).
- [x] **Long-running operation timeout consolidation** _(shipped)_ — `LONG_RUNNING_OP_TIMEOUT_MS` defined once in `shell/src/plugins/nexus/constants.ts` and consumed by `nexus/agent/index.ts` (`RUN_TIMEOUT_MS`) and `nexus/workflow/index.ts` (`RUN_TIMEOUT_MS`); `SERVICE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` similarly consumed by `nexus/mcp/index.ts`.
- [x] **Buffer / event caps** _(shipped)_ — `PROCESS_EVENTS_CAP` named in `processesStore.ts`; `UNDO_HISTORY_CAP` lives in `shell/src/plugins/nexus/constants.ts` and is shared by `bases/basesStore.ts` + `canvas/canvasStore.ts` so the user-perceptible undo depth is consistent across surfaces.

## Architecture review (2026-04-16) — microkernel adherence

## UI architecture review (2026-04-16) — editor-shell pattern

### Code gaps

### PRD gap — no owner for plugin-contributed tab surfaces

## Editor-shell capability gaps (2026-04-16) — vs VS Code / Obsidian / IntelliJ

### Spec'd in a PRD, not yet implemented

### Half-specced: manifest keys exist, but no UI/wiring spec in PRD-07

### Not in any PRD — new spec work needed

## Architecture audit (2026-04-16) — follow-ups

Findings surfaced by the microkernel + editor-shell audit that weren't already tracked above.

## Microkernel hardening — 2026-04-16 audit findings

Findings from `docs/archive/planning/MICROKERNEL-AUDIT.md` not yet tracked. Ordered by audit priority. The three 🔴 items and F-9.2.1 are blockers before any public plugin marketplace.

### 🔴 Red — blockers for untrusted plugin distribution

_None outstanding._ F-2.1.1 closed 2026-04-22 — see archive.

### 🟠 Orange — address before marketplace or next minor release

### 🟡 Yellow — quality / correctness improvements

## Suspected issues — not fully investigated

Threads from `docs/archive/planning/MICROKERNEL-AUDIT.md §Suspected Issues` that warrant a targeted code walk.

- [ ] **Hot-reload timing on macOS and Windows.** `notify-debouncer-mini` behaviour differs across platforms; F-4.3.1 covers one class of issue. A targeted cross-platform reliability pass on the hot-reload path would be worthwhile before shipping community plugin hot-reload as a feature. **Deferred** — requires running the shell on macOS and Windows hardware to reproduce and measure; this repo's test host is Linux/WSL only. Track for a dedicated cross-platform QA pass once a macOS/Windows CI runner or test machine is available.

## UI audit (2026-04-16) — follow-ups

Findings from `docs/archive/planning/UI-AUDIT.md` not yet tracked above. IDs reference the audit. The 🔴 items plus F-9.1.1 are blockers before any untrusted-plugin distribution.

### 🔴 Red — cannot ship to untrusted users without these

_F-8.1.1 (sub-tasks 1–5: iframe scaffold + sandbox flags, postMessage protocol, `NexusPluginContext` proxy, per-plugin manifest `sandboxed` flag, CSP + tests), **F-8.1.1-fo1** (precompiled `bootstrapSandboxedPlugin` runtime bundle + hello-world migration), and **F-8.1.2** (boundary-bound `pluginId` — orchestrator builds a per-plugin `PluginAPI` from the handshake-set id; `assertValidPluginId` rejects empty / colon-bearing ids) shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md). All red-tier UI items now closed; remaining gating for community marketplace launch is **WI-44** (marketplace UI / index / signing) and **OI-15** (manifest signing) at the orange tier._

> F-9.1.1 (validate `api_version` at load time) is the UI twin of the microkernel 🟠 item of the same ID already tracked above — no duplicate entry.

### 🟠 Orange — substantive design gaps, schedule before next external release

- [ ] **Memory budget / accounting for script plugins (UI F-8.3.1).** WASM plugins have `memory_mb = 8` in their manifest; script plugins have no equivalent and allocate against the WebView heap directly. A plugin that accumulates a 500 MB structure OOMs the whole shell. **Now unblocked** — F-8.1.1 shipped 2026-04-28 (per-plugin iframe boundary in `shell/src/host/sandbox/SandboxOrchestrator.ts`). `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()` is per-frame, so the orchestrator can poll each iframe and attribute usage by `data-sandbox-plugin`. Today still unimplemented; a misbehaving script plugin's RSS is indistinguishable from the shell's. Track as a sandboxed-plugin watchdog enhancement.

### 🟡 Yellow — rough edges to fix opportunistically

### Suspected issues — UI audit §6 spike candidates

Threads from `docs/archive/planning/UI-AUDIT.md §6` not yet confirmed. Each is a 1–2 day targeted code walk or runtime probe.

- [x] **SI-1 — Blob-URL same-origin inheritance.** **Closed 2026-04-28** as a duplicate of F-8.1.1. The blob-URL same-origin inheritance behaviour is confirmed (MDN spec — a `blob:` URL inherits the origin of its creator), but it no longer matters for sandboxed plugins: `manifest.sandboxed === true` routes the plugin through `SandboxOrchestrator`, which mounts a null-origin iframe (`sandbox="allow-scripts"`, no `allow-same-origin`). Inside that iframe the host's blob URL is reachable for the bundle import but the iframe runs at `event.origin === "null"` so it can't read `window.parent.document` / `document.cookie` / Tauri's IPC bridge. Legacy non-sandboxed plugins still inherit the shell's origin — that's the "first-party only" trust posture documented in `DEPRECATED.md`.
- [ ] **SI-6 — `PluginManager` Mutex contention.** **Deferred — requires a dedicated load-test harness that doesn't exist yet.** Measuring requires 20+ chatty plugins and wall-clock profiling while a human drives the UI, which this environment cannot replicate. Hypothesis: per-plugin dispatch already uses `try_lock` + reentrancy guard + per-plugin backend mutex, so the `PluginManager` top-level mutex is only held during scan/load/unload/reload — not during steady-state dispatch. If the hypothesis holds this is cosmetic; if not, the fix is likely `RwLock<HashMap<id, …>>` inside the loader with per-plugin reader locks. Track as an explicit Phase-3 stability task once the load-test tooling exists.

## Audit findings (2026-04-28)

> Cross-PRD docs audit ([DOCS_AUDIT_2026-04-28.md](DOCS_AUDIT_2026-04-28.md)) — items spec'd in a PRD that are not yet built and were not previously assigned a backlog ID. Each cites the PRD section, target crate, and estimated effort. Effort scale: small ≈ ½–2 days, medium ≈ 3–10 days, large ≈ 2+ weeks.

_BL-010 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-011 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-012 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### BL-012 close-out: native parser/serializer for `[[{db:…}]]`

Extend the `nexus-editor` markdown parser/serializer to recognise the `[[{db:…}]]` syntax natively. Today the editor block-tree treats it as `Embed`; the CM widget already handles it because it scans source text directly. Once native, `BlockType::DatabaseView` round-trips through `MarkdownSerializer::serialize` / `MarkdownParser::parse` and the editor's undo tree captures spec edits as block-level transactions instead of free-text replacements.

_BL-013 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-015 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### BL-016: AI tool registration for LLM function-calling

**Source**: PRD-12 §8.1 (`ToolRegistry`, `ToolExecutor`, built-in `read_file` / `write_file` / etc.).
**Effort**: Medium. **Crate**: `nexus-ai`.
Distinct from the agent's MCP discovery (which appends *tool descriptions* to the planner prompt). Native function-calling means surfacing Anthropic / OpenAI `tools` and Ollama tool-call format from `stream_chat`, dispatching the model's tool-calls back through `ipc_call`. Today providers strip tool params before the request.
**Cross-references (2026-04-28)**: prerequisite for BL-010, BL-011, BL-027, BL-035 (right-click AI actions / block AI actions), BL-036 (margin / inline correction), and the memory layer's "recall as a tool" flow (BL-044). Treat as Phase-1 foundation; downstream agents queue behind it. Split per the implementation plan: (1) `ToolRegistry` + `ToolExecutor` core, (2) Anthropic + OpenAI tool-call wire format, (3) Ollama tool-call format + dispatch loop.

_BL-019 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-021 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-022 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-023 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-025 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-027 shipped 2026-04-29 — see BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md._

_BL-028 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-029 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-030 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

## Future-direction items minted into the backlog (2026-04-28)

> The four future-direction tracks were brought into the implementation plan on 2026-04-28. The IDs below carry their FD doc as design rationale; the original entries in the "Future directions" section now point here. Effort scale: S ≈ ½–2 days, M ≈ 3–10 days, L ≈ 2+ weeks.

### BL-032: Cmd+I command-anywhere AI overlay

**Source**: [../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md](../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md) pattern 1.
**Effort**: Medium. **Crate / Package**: `shell/src/plugins/nexus/ai/` (new) + `shell/src/host/` (registry hook).
A modal overlay invocable from any focused surface (editor, bases, canvas, terminal, files) that takes a free-form prompt and routes through the shared context-assembly service. Surface-specific context contributors (current selection, current file, current row, current canvas node) register adapters at activation. **Gates BL-010 / BL-011 UX** — land Cmd+I before the CLI surfaces so they share UX and engine. Scope excludes citations (BL-038) and right-click actions (BL-035), which compose on top.

_BL-033 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-034 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### BL-035: Right-click AI actions + block AI actions (shared registry)

_BL-035 shipped 2026-04-29 — see BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md._

### BL-036: AMB margin suggestions + inline correction

**Source**: [../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md](../AI-AMBIENT-COPILOT-PLAN.md) patterns 6 + 9.
**Effort**: Medium.
Background pass over the active document surfaces non-blocking margin glyphs ("rephrase", "fact-check", "tighten") that expand into accept/dismiss diffs in the gutter; inline correction is the same engine for typos / grammar with squiggle decoration. Hard prereq: BL-016 tool-calling so suggestions can call domain tools (e.g. dictionary).

_BL-037 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-038 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-039 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-040 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-041 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-042 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-043 shipped 2026-04-28 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-044 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### BL-045: MEM auto-enrichment on save

_BL-045 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-046 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### BL-046 phase 3: per-language chip row in recall

Drive a per-language sub-chip row from `extractCodeLanguages` over the active recall result set, so a user with both rust and ts captures sees both pills inline. Opportunistic on top of the v1 binary "From project" chip — the helper already exists from phase 2; the surface work is rendering the pills and routing each pill's toggle through the existing filter path.

### BL-047: MEM scheduled digests

_BL-047 shipped 2026-04-29 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-048 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### BL-048 phase 3: opportunistic auto-stamp on dragstart

Kick off `stamp_block` + `save` from the block-handle drag bridge when the source block is unstamped, so cross-plugin drops from un-stamped blocks don't carry the rot-prone `deterministic_block_id`. Pair with a "Stamp block" right-click affordance on the block handle so the user has a deliberate path to promote a block to a stable id without dragging it.

_BL-049 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-050 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

_BL-051 shipped 2026-04-30 — see [BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md](BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md)._

### Verification notes (no BL ID — informational)

- **ADR-0009 keyring hard-fail enforcement** — Verified 2026-04-30: bootstrap-side enforcement is **missing**. `nexus_security::CredentialVault::available()` and the `NEXUS_NO_KEYRING=1` escape hatch are implemented in `crates/nexus-security/src/credential.rs`, but no caller (`SecurityCorePlugin::on_init`/`on_start`, `nexus-bootstrap`, or any frontend) exercises the probe — Nexus boots cleanly with a broken keyring and only fails on first credential operation. Filed as **OI-21** in [../OPEN-ITEMS.md](../OPEN-ITEMS.md).
- **PRD-04a MockPluginContext / MockEventBus** — referenced in template tests as TODO but not yet exposed from `nexus-plugin-api`. Low priority; community plugin authors are not yet writing many tests, and the issue surfaces only when someone tries.

## Decisions — PRD-04 audit (2026-04-17)

## Design notes — 2026-04-28

- **Global cross-surface undo is a non-goal.** Considered alongside BL-030. Per-surface undo is the idiom in VS Code / Obsidian / IntelliJ; a unified Cmd+Z spanning editor + canvas + bases + file ops creates ambiguous "what does this undo right now" behaviour and would require every mutating IPC handler to register an inverse op against the file-as-truth + IPC-only invariants. The right primitive for cross-surface time-travel in this architecture is git-based history (point-in-time restore via the existing commit graph) rather than a unified action stack. New BL items for undo should be scoped to a single surface.

### Phase-0 ADRs (gating the implementation plan)

Two design decisions sat on the critical path of the multi-phase rollout. Both Phase-0 ADRs were drafted, reviewed, and accepted on 2026-04-28; the rest of the plan now executes against their answers.

- **[ADR-0017: Block-ID stability via lazy inline stamping](../adr/0017-block-id-stability.md)** _(Accepted 2026-04-28)_ — chooses HTML-comment stamping inside markdown, materialised on-demand the first time a block is referenced cross-session. Unblocks BL-048 (drag-to-embed), BL-049 (block-links navigator), BL-050 (side-margin comments).

- **[ADR-0018: Local embedding backend — fastembed-rs](../adr/0018-embedding-backend.md)** _(Accepted 2026-04-28)_ — chooses fastembed-rs over candle and sqlite-vec's bundled gguf path on the 5-axis comparison (model quality, RAM, cold-start, cross-platform binary cost, license). Unblocks BL-019 plus the nine downstream consumers (BL-038 / BL-039 / BL-040 / BL-041 / BL-044 / BL-045 / BL-047 and the BL-010 / BL-011 / BL-034 retrieval variants).

## Implementation plan (2026-04-28)

> Phased rollout for every non-deferred BL item including the future-direction items minted as BL-032..BL-051 above. Cross-references all live in those entries; this section is the schedule.

### Agent-load assumptions

- **One agent ≈ 1–3 days of focused work, single tractable PR.** Items rated >medium must split into multiple agent-sized chunks (splits are listed per-item below).
- **2 concurrent foreground agents + 1 background long-runner.** The fg slots are sized so the human review queue stays drainable; the bg slot is reserved for multi-week work (F-8.1.1 in particular).
- **Agents that overlap files waste work in merges**, so file-conflict groups must serialize within their group.
- Retune assumptions: 1 fg + 0 bg roughly doubles the timeline; 3 fg + 1 bg lets BL-022 / BL-029 / BL-037 land earlier and compresses Phases 3–6 by ~3 weeks.

### File-conflict groups (serialize within group)

| Group | Items |
|---|---|
| Bases plugin | BL-015 → BL-030 → BL-031 |
| nexus-cli AI subcommands | BL-010 → BL-011 |
| nexus-mcp client | BL-023 → BL-025 |
| nexus-mcp server | BL-042 (distinct from client group above) |
| Skills | BL-021 → BL-022 |
| nexus-ai (Cargo + provider mods) | BL-016, BL-019 — keep one full PR apart |
| Shell host / sandbox | F-8.1.1 → F-8.1.2 |
| AI overlay surface | BL-032 → BL-033 → BL-034 |
| Memory inbox surface | BL-043 → BL-046 |

### Hard dependency chain

| Prereq | Unblocks |
|---|---|
| BL-016 tool-calling | BL-010, BL-011, BL-027, BL-035, BL-036, BL-044 |
| BL-019 embeddings | BL-038, BL-039, BL-040, BL-041, BL-044, BL-045, BL-047, plus BL-010/11/34 retrieval variants |
| BL-013 stream convention | future plugin streaming work |
| BL-015 trash view | BL-030 (reuses row-restore code path) |
| BL-030 undo stack | BL-031 (paste = one undo step) |
| BL-032 Cmd+I overlay | BL-010 / BL-011 / BL-033 / BL-044 (shared UX) |
| BL-041 indexing daemon | BL-045 (auto-enrichment reads the index) |
| F-8.1.1 iframe sandbox | F-8.1.2, marketplace |
| Block-id stability ADR | BL-048, BL-049, BL-050 |

### Phased rollout

| Phase | Wks | Agent A (fg) | Agent B (fg) | Agent C (bg) | Phase exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Quick wins + ADRs** | 1.5 | settings ×5 + BL-009 + BL-015 | (idle / pulls Phase-1 prep) | block-id ADR + embedding-backend ADR | both ADRs signed and recorded under "Decisions"; trash view live in bases; foundations clear for Phase 1 |
| **1 — Foundations** | 6 | **BL-016** (split ×3) | **BL-013** stream convention + **BL-032** Cmd+I overlay | **F-8.1.1** kickoff (split ×5; per-plugin migration posture — see below) | BL-016 merged → unblocks AI surfaces; BL-032 lands → unblocks BL-010/11; F-8.1.1 sandbox scaffold reachable |
| **2 — Bases + AI CLI/UI** | 4 | BL-030 → BL-031 → **BL-043** quick-capture hotkey | BL-010 + BL-034 ghost suggestions (paired engine) → BL-011 | F-8.1.1 cont. | bases polish complete; shared chat + completion engine live in CLI and editor; global capture hotkey live |
| **3 — Skills + MCP client + small AMB** | 5 | BL-021 (split ×4) → BL-022 | BL-023 → BL-025; BL-033 chips/switcher slots in | F-8.1.1 wraps; **F-8.1.2** | skills composition lands; MCP client gains WS/SSE + auth |
| **4 — Heavy AI core** | 8 | **BL-019** (split ×4) | **BL-027** agent loops (split ×5) | BL-035 right-click + block-AI actions | BL-019 unblocks all retrieval consumers; BL-027 unlocks orchestrated agents |
| **5 — Retrieval consumers** | 5 | BL-040 semantic search → BL-039 auto-links → BL-038 citations | BL-041 indexing daemon → BL-045 auto-enrichment → BL-044 recall | BL-047 scheduled digests | the BL-019 dependency tail drains |
| **6 — Heavyweights + multi-window** | 8 | BL-028 workflow umbrella (split ≥6) | BL-029 multi-window → BL-037 timeline → BL-050 side-margin comments | BL-042 Nexus-as-MCP-server | multi-window opens, panes follow; workflow gains every spec'd trigger |
| **7 — Editor + Notion polish** | 6 | BL-012 DB query blocks (split ×5) | BL-049 block-links → BL-051 multi-cursor → BL-048 drag-to-embed | BL-046 code-aware capture; BL-036 margin / inline correction | tail polish; backlog drained to deferred-only items |

Cumulative: ~44 weeks raw, ~50–55 with PR-review buffer at the assumed 2 fg + 1 bg slot budget.

### Sub-task splits (items >medium)

| BL | Split |
|---|---|
| BL-016 | (1) `ToolRegistry` + `ToolExecutor` core, (2) Anthropic + OpenAI tool-call wire format, (3) Ollama tool-call format + dispatch loop |
| BL-019 | (1) backend impl (per ADR), (2) `EmbeddingModel` trait + cache, (3) RAG wire-up, (4) batch indexer hook for BL-041 |
| BL-021 | (1) parse `depends_on`, (2) topo + cycle detection, (3) prompt-fragment merge order, (4) conflict-warning UX |
| BL-027 | (1) `AgentOrchestrator` skeleton, (2) `delegate`, (3) `parallel`, (4) `pipeline`, (5) shared scratch state + replay hooks |
| BL-028 | one agent per primitive: webhook trigger → git_event → mcp_event → parallel scheduler → retry/backoff → AI step types → templates |
| BL-012 | (1) executor over `apply_view`, (2) CM6 widget, (3) decoration plumbing, (4) undo integration, (5) filter/sort UX |
| F-8.1.1 | (1) iframe scaffold + sandbox flags, (2) postMessage protocol, (3) `NexusPluginContext` proxy, (4) per-plugin migration via `manifest.toml` `sandbox: "iframe" \| "legacy"` flag, (5) CSP + tests. Per-plugin migration posture (decided 2026-04-28) — community plugins keep working during the multi-week build window; cost is +1–2 wks vs hard cutover. |

### Risks tracked

1. **Phase-2 lock-in.** BL-010 / BL-011 / BL-034 share an engine. If BL-032 (Cmd+I) shifts after Phase-1, three tracks rework.
2. **BL-019 is the single biggest schedule bet.** Nine tracks queue behind it; a backend mistake costs weeks. The Phase-0 ADR is non-negotiable.
3. **BL-029 promotion** means earlier multi-window, which means earlier per-window plumbing problems for plugin lifecycle. Worth a lightweight design pass before Phase-6 begins.
4. **F-8.1.1** runs 1–2 eng-months in the background. If it slips into Phase-4, BL-035 (right-click in iframe-sandboxed plugins) gets harder to test.
5. **BL-022 absorbs MEM "code-aware capture" UI patterns** in Phase 3 — make sure the skill-editor surface is pluggable enough to host them rather than blocking on a separate capture UI.

### Phase-0 entry / exit checklist

- [x] Block-id stability ADR drafted, reviewed, recorded under "Decisions".
- [x] Embedding-backend ADR drafted with the 5-axis comparison (quality / RAM / cold-start / binary cost / license), recorded under "Decisions".
- [x] BL-009 mermaid whole-file viewer merged.
- [x] BL-015 bases trash view merged.
- [x] Settings extraction queue (5 items) — all shipped; see "Settings extraction queue" section above for per-item file references.
- [x] No outstanding regressions in `cargo test --workspace` / `pnpm --filter nexus-shell test` / `scripts/check_ipc_drift.sh` _(verified 2026-04-30 on `claude/review-backlog-AOGDH`: 75 result blocks all `0 failed`; 681/681 shell tests; drift `OK — generated trees match HEAD`)_.

(BL-043 quick-capture hotkey moved to Phase 2 — Tauri global-hotkey plumbing is a 1–2 day task disguised as "small" and would eat into ADR review.)
